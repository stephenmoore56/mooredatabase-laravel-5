# mooredatabase-laravel-5
This is my latest project.  It was originally intended for conversion of a Laravel 4 / PHP 5 site to laravel 5.3 / PHP 7.  Once that work was completed, I began conversion of the Angular 1 application to Angular 2.

So, the application architecture makes use of:
* PHP 7
* Laravel 5.3
* Bootstrap 3
* Angular 2
* jQuery
* MySQL 5.7 database
* MySQL stored procedures

The Angular 2 application gets its data from a JSON API developed using the Lumen framework.  Code for the JSON API is in a separate repository (mooredatabase-lumen).
