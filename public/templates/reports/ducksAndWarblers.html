			These graphs illustrate the different migration patterns for ducks (family Anatidae of order Anseriformes) and
			warblers (family Parulidae of order Passeriformes) and how they correlate with temperature:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Ducks arrive early to Minnesota and depart late; the diversity
				of ducks peaks in April and November.  Spring and fall duck migrations are triggered
				by ice-out and ice-in, respectively.
			</li>
			<li>
				Warblers arrive later and depart earlier than ducks; the diversity of warblers
				peaks in May and September.  Spring and fall warbler migrations are triggered largely by the
				availability of insects for food, which is in turn a function of temperature.
			</li>
		</ul>
